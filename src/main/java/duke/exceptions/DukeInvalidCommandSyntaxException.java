 * DukeInvalidCommandSyntaxException indicates that a user-supplied command has an invalid syntax

 * that the command is a valid command, because it may not correspond to any known commands or
 * has the wrong options.
 * All commands must have the syntax "main-command [/option option-args | args...]"
