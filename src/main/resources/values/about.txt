This is a duke chatbot, which supports command line input to add todo, deadline and event tasks.
The chatbot also supports the basic options of deleting and listing all of these tasks. You can also mark and unmark
tasks to show whether you have completed them.
We store all of your tasks locally so you never lose track of them even when the application is restarted.
