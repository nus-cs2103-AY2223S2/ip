## Features 

### Tracking Tasks

## Usage

### Adding Tasks
Tasks can be **added** to C4PO's memory, to allow yourself to keep track of your tasks.
There are a few types of tasks to add, namely:

- Todo `todo {taskname} /priority {int}`
- Deadline `deadline {taskname} /by {yyyy-MM-dd} /priority {int}`
- Event `event {taskname} /from {start} /to {end} /priority {int}`

### Marking or Un-marking Tasks
Tasks can be marked as done with the `mark` command, followed by the index of the task (based on task-list) separated by a space. 
For example `mark 1` will result in the first task in the list to be marked as done `[X] FirstTask`


### Sorting by priority

Users can sort their tasks by priority using the `priority` command.
An example given this list:
#### Current List:
```
1. [T][ ] Clean Room (priority: 2)
2. [E][X] Dinner with friends (priority: 6) (from:
5pm to: 7pm)
3. [D][ ] First Essay Draft (priority: 10) (by: Friday Feb 11 2022)

```

#### Output:
```
