# Sunday User Guide

## Features 

### Task Creation

Sunday allows users to create 3 different types of tasks:
* Todos
* Deadlines
* Events

Each task created has a description and a due date if the task is a Deadline or
a start and end date and time if the task is an Event.

### Task Listing

Sunday can list all tasks that are currently saved in the user's list of tasks.

### Task Completion

Users can mark or unmark tasks as complete.

### Search

Users can search for tasks with keyword search.

### Minimalist Ui

Our Ui design approach emphasizes simplicity and functionality over unnecessary decoration
or visual elements. It features a clean and uncluttered layout, with only the essential elements
to improve usability and user experience as it reduces cognitive load and eliminates distractions.

## Usage

### `hello` - Say hello to Sunday

The `hello` command serves as an initializer for Sunday.

This is the **first command** that should be given on every startup. It will request Sunday to attempt
to fetch the saved list of tasks from the previous session, if any.

Example of usage: 

`hello`

Expected outcome:

Sunday will greet the user with a welcome message and state if a save file was successfully loaded.
Here's an example of Sunday's response to a new user:

```
Hi! I'm Sunday, pleasure to meet you!
How can I help?
It appears we haven't met!
Start typing away your tasks and I'll note them down accordingly :)
```

### `list` - View your list of tasks

The `list` command alerts Sunday to display your current list of tasks.

Example of usage:

`list`

Expected outcome:

Each task is prefixed with 2 fields, the first to denote the task type,
the second to denote the completion status of the task.

```
