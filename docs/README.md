## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `find TASK`, `TASK` is a parameter which can be used as `find borrow book`.

* Parameters cannot be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `event project meeting /from Mon 2pm /to 4pm`, `event project meeting /to 4pm /from Mon 4pm` is unacceptable.

</div>

### Adding a task: ` `

Adds a task to Duke chatbot.

Format:
- `NAME`
- `event NAME /from START_TIME_AND_DATE /to ENDTIME`
- `deadline NAME /by DUEDATE`
- `todo NAME`

Examples:
* `Borrow book`
* `todo borrow book`
* `deadline return book /by Sunday`

**The new customised task added is a recur task. Please follow the
instructions below to test it out**

1. To add a recur task, type "recur", followed by a single word task name, and
   the period of repetition in ms.
2. For example, if I want a recur task study to run 1s periodically, I will
   type "recur study 1000".
3. You should see the recur task popping up. You will be able to do other
   tasks meanwhile since the recur task runs on a different thread.
4. To delete the recur task, type "recur delete", followed by the nth recur
   task that you intend to delete. The list starts from index 1.
5. For example, if I want to delete the first recur task, I will type "recur
   delete 1"

### Adding a recurring / reminder task: `recur`

* Persons matching all keywords will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
  e.g. `borrow book` will return `book book mythical-man-month`

### Deleting a task : `delete`

Deletes the specified task from Duke chatbot.

Format: `delete INDEX`
