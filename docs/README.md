# User Guide

<br>

## Hello from Duke!
Duke is a chatbot that helps you manage your day-to-day tasks by keeping a list.
It provides you with many features to manage your tasks effectively.
> This chatbot is named after Duke, the Mascot of Java - the language it is built in.

<br>

## What is a **_Task_**?
Tasks can be of three types:
1. **_To-do_** - tasks that have no time constraints
2. **_Deadline_** - tasks that have to be completed within a particular date-time
3. **_Event_** - tasks that have particular start and end date-time's

<br>

All tasks have a status associated with them - done `[X]`, and undone `[ ]`.
> All tasks are set to be _undone_ by default. However, you can set the status of a task to be _done_.

<br>

All tasks also have a priority associated with them - high / medium / low.
> All tasks are set to medium priority by default. However, you can change it later.

<br>

### To-do
A to-do is represented in the form:
```
[T]{<priority>}[<status>] <description>
```

Example representation:
```
[T]{low}[ ] read book
```

<br>

### Deadline
A deadline is represented in the form:
```
[D]{<priority>}[<status>] <description> (by: <date-time this deadline is to be completed by>)
```

Example representation:
```
[D]{high}[X] assignment (by: Feb 20 2023 11:59 PM)
```

<br>

### Event
An event is represented in the form:
```
[E]{<priority>}[<status>] <description> (from: <start date-time> ; to: <end date-time>)
```

Example representation:
```
[E]{medium}[ ] lecture (from: Feb 21 2023 03:00 PM ; to: Feb 21 2023 05:00 PM)
```
