üí° Notes about the command format

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
  e.g. in `todo NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `todo My homework`.
- Parameters in square brackets are optional.
  e.g. in `deadline NAME /by DATE [TIME]`, `TIME` is an optional parameter.

  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
