# User Guide

If this is your first time booting up the app, it should come with default tasks pre-loaded.
If not, a sample storage is given here: https://github.com/ajjajjajjajj/ip/blob/A-Release/src/main/resources/storage/default-storage.txt  
Download it, rename it to storage.txt and place it in the data folder (the data folder 
should be in the same directory level as duke.jar
