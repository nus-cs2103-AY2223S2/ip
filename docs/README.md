# User Guide
## Duke
Duke is a todo Command Line Interface (CLI) app that helps you manage your todos, deadlines 
and events while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Features 
* list
* mark
* unmark
* todo
* deadline
* event
* delete
* find
* help
* bye

#### Things to take note about the format:
Words in `<>` are parameters that **must be supplied** by the user.
e.g. mark <task number>, the user must key in a task number when using mark commands.

Adding **extra parameters** for list and bye commands will be **ignored**.
e.g. Entering list 123 will be interpreted as list.

Commands supplied must be in **lowercase**.
