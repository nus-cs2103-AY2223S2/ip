# User Guide for BooBot
BooBot is a **desktop application** that helps you to keep track of your tasks, saving time and
ensuring that you are on track. Problems would be scared away with good task management provided by
BooBot. While there is a Graphical User Interface (GUI), users would mostly interact with BooBot
via text commands.

### Saving and Loading of Data
Your task list would be saved automatically whenever a change to the list is made in the
application. The data for the task list is stored locally on your computer, in a file called
`data.txt` which is found in the same directory as the BootBot release.

You are free to look into the file and modify the data as needed, but avoid tampering with the
format. If the format is altered, BooBot will not be able to read the data and this would risk
your original data being overwritten by BooBot.
