## Introduction
The Mr. Bear Application is a chatbot designed to assist users with various tasks, made by [Zhu Yufan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yufan-zhu-36024a225/) under the module CS2103T 2022/23 Sem 2. 

This project, Mr. Bear, is based on [Project Duke](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S2/ip) and is an educational tool that helps new software developers improve their skills through the gradual construction of the project and the discovery of various software engineering principles.
