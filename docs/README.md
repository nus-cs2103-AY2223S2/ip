## Features 

---

### Add Tasks

You can type tasks, deadlines, and events into the text box, and hit `Enter` or
click on `Send` - The app will store the tasks for you!

### View Tasks

You can query the storage to see what tasks you have stored.

### Find Tasks

You can query the storage to see which tasks contain a certain keyword, or fall
on a certain date.

### Manipulate Tasks

You can mark tasks as *done*, mark them as *not completed*, or *delete* them
- all by text description, list index, or date!

### Import Tasks

The app stores tasks as a `.txt` file as `data/RICKS_BRAIN.TXT` in the same 
folder as the app - simply rename your own `TXT` file and our app can import 
your tasks from elsewhere! This also allows the app to save tasks to storage 
when you quit the app.

## Frequently Asked Questions

---

**Q**: How do I import a text file?<br/>
**A**: Here's a view of the file directory where you store your app:
```text
. (Folder you are in)
├── data (new folder)
│   └── RICKSBRAIN.TXT
└── rick.jar
```
Simply rename your text file as `RICKS_BRAIN.TXT`, and replace the existing
`.txt` file. Restart the app, and your tasks should be imported! You may also
transfer this file to another machine so that you can access your tasks there.

**Q**: Cool! Now how do I format this file?<br/>
**A**: The file is simply formatted in this way:
- `Todo`: `T|1|{desc}` - `T` for Todo, **1** for completed, task description
- `Deadline`: `D|0|{desc}|deadline` `D` for Deadline, **0** for not completed,
  task description, deadline in `d/M/yy HHmm` format
- `Event`: `E|1|{desc}|start|end` `E` for Event, **1** for completed, event
  description, start and end datetime each in `d/M/yy HHmm` format

Example:
```shell
##data/RICKS_BRAIN.TXT
T|1|task one
D|0|deadline one|2/2/23 1200
E|1|event one|2/2/23 1200|3/2/23 1200
```
An improper format may crash the app, and your file may be corrupted.

**Q**: Must I use the graphic interface (GUI)? Can't it be used in a terminal
environment? <br/>
**A**: It can! Simply update the `src/main/rick/Rick.java` file to print and
receive commands from the terminal, instead of sending the responses to the GUI
package classes.
