## Date-time formatting
- Date-time inputs should have the general format of `dd MMM yyyy HHmm`, where:
  - `dd` is the day of the month in numerical form; _e.g. `dd` for 3rd May would be `03`_, for 24th it would be `24`
  - `MMM` is the first 3 letters of the month; _e.g, August in `MMM` format is `Aug` (case-insensitive)_
  - `yy` is the last two digits of the year; _e.g. 2034 in `yy` format is `34`_
  - `HHmm` is the time in 24-hour format
- Additionally, users can use the numerical format of the month instead of the shorted string format
- Users can also omit the first two digits of the year and the minutes of the time
- **_Sample date time inputs:_** Both `03 Mar 2023 1200` and `03 03 23 12` are equivalent to **_3rd March 2023 12:00pm_**
