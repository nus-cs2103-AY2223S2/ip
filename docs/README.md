## Usage

### List available tasks: `list`

Lists all tasks previously created and not deleted.

**Example of usage**:

`list`

**Expected outcome**:

All tasks previously created and not deleted are listed in order of creation.

### Create a todo: `todo`

Creates one todo. A todo is the simplest type of task, with just a text description and no associated date or time.

**Example of usage**:

`todo find atlantis`

**Expected outcome**:

A new task with the description "find atlantis" is created.

### Create a deadline: `deadline`

Creates a task with a deadline. The deadline must be in the `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm` format.

**Example of usage**:

`deadline write a user guide /by 11/02/2023 2359`

**Expected outcome**:

A new task with the description "write a user guide" is created, with the associated deadline of 2nd February 2023, 11:59pm.

### Create an event: `event`

Creates an event. An event is a type of task with a specified start and end time. The date and time must be in `dd/MM/yyyy HHmm` format.

**Example of usage**:

`event gotoubun movie preview /from 12/10/2022 1500 /to 12/10/2022 1700`

**Expected outcome**:

A new event with the description "gotoubun movie preview" is created, with the associated duration of 12th October 2022 3:00pm to 5:00pm.

### Complete a task: `mark`

Marks a task as completed. To select a task to complete, first use `list` to observe its current index. Then proceed to mark the task by its index, as per the example below. If the task was already marked as completed, then nothing happens.

**Example of usage:**

`mark 1`

**Expected outcome:**

The task with index 1 (obtained via `list`) is marked as completed.

### Undo completion: `unmark`

Undoes a completion of a task. This is the reverse of `mark`. The task is selected by its index, obtainable through the `list` command. If the task was already incomplete, then nothing happens.

**Example of usage**:

`unmark 1`

**Expected outcome**:

The task with index 1 is marked as incomplete.

### Delete a task: `delete`

Deletes a task. As with `mark`, a task can be selected using its index, which is checked by first using `list`. Note that deletion is not reversible.

**Example of usage**:

`delete 1`

**Expected outcome**:

The task with index 1 is deleted.

### Find a task: `find`

Finds tasks via a simple keyword search. All tasks with descriptions containing the exact phrase provided will be returned.

**Example of usage**:

`find date`

**Expected outcome**:

All tasks with the word "date" in its description are listed.

### Tag a task: `tag`

Tags a task with some tags. A task can have any number of tags. A tag must be a single token, e.g. `foo` or `bar` is fine, but `foo bar` is not. The task is selected by its index from running the `list` command.

**Example of usage**:

`tag 1 work urgent`

**Expected outcome**:

The task at index 1 is tagged with `work` and `urgent`.

### Match tasks by all tags: `tagall`

Finds all tasks which have at least _all_ the tags provided. For example, if the task is tagged with at least `work` and `urgent`, then `tagall work urgent` will match it. However, if the task is tagged with `work` but not `urgent`, then `tagall work urgent` will not match it.

**Example of usage**:

`tagall work urgent`

**Expected outcome**:

All tasks which were previously tagged with `work` and `urgent` are listed.

### Match tasks by any tag: `tagany`

Finds all tasks which have at least _one of_ the tags provided. For example, if the task is tagged with at least `work` or `urgent`, then `tagany work urgent` will match it. However, if the task is tagged with neither `work` nor `urgent`, then `tagany work urgent` will not match it.

**Example of usage**:

`tagany work urgent`

**Expected outcome**:

All tasks which were previously tagged with `work` or `urgent` are listed.

### Inspect tags: `tagsee`

Inspects the tags for a task. The task is selected by its index from running the `list` command.

**Example of usage**:

`tagsee 1`

**Expected outcome**:

The tags associated with task 1 are listed.
