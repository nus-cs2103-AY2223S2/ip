## Features that Wessy has 

### Able to keep track of the tasks you need to do.

The task with fixed duration (using the `fix` command) can record exactly how much time is required to do the task.

### Able to tick off the tasks that you have completed.
This can be achieved by marking those tasks that are completed via the `mark` command. This action can be undone using the `unmark`.
