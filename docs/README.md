## Features 
XyDuck is equipped with 4 main features to enhance your task-tracking experience! :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

**TRY NOW** to become a **MASTER** at tracking commitments!

Please find details on what they are and how they can be used below.

### 1. Tracking Tasks :pencil:

The most basic but also the most useful feature. Add and delete tasks as you wish! Customise your task descriptions! Add deadlines to your tasks!

### 2. Marking Tasks :pencil2:

Too many commitments and can't remember which you have completed? Fret not as XyDuck is equipped with a marking feature that allows you to mark tasks as *complete* or *incomplete*. Don't worry if you marked wrongly, you can change it just as easily!

### 3. Listing Tasks :pen:

This is probably the best feature of XyDuck! List your tasks in the order in which you they were added, or sort them by order of their deadlines! You'll never have to worry about missing an assignment deadline again!

### 4. Saving Tasks 	:fountain_pen:

XyDuck's final feature is the ability to save your tasks. XyDuck automatically saves all changes you've made in a particular session when you bid it farewell, and reflects these changes the next time you boot it up!
