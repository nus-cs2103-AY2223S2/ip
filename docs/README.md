# Nemo User Guide
:ocean::tropical_fish:**If you're a little forgetful (like Dory), don't worry, Nemo's got your back.** :ocean::tropical_fish:

**Nemo is a chatbot task tracker that takes in CLI inputs to store and manage tasks, deadlines and events.**

> "I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my familyâ€¦ well, at least I think it does... hmm, where are they?" - Dory

## Quick Start

3. Put the Nemo `jar` file into your desired folder.
4. Run `java -jar .\nemo.jar` to start the app.

## Features

### Track your Tasks!
:writing_hand: Nemo supports the following 3 types of tasks. 
1. **ToDos** - a task that needs to be completed eventually
2. **Deadlines** - a task that has a deadline for completion
3. **Events** - a task that has a start and end date

### Save and Load your Tasks!
:sunglasses: Nemo will save any changes to your task list into a data directory. This way you can load tasks that you had added in a previous session, or share these tasks with a friend.

### Undo and Redo any changes!
:astonished: Nemo supports undoing and redoing any changes you make to the task tracker in that session.
