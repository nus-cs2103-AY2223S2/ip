## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) <a name="faq"></a>

> **I'm unsure of the task number of the task I want to delete/mark/unmark. How can I obtain that?**<br>

*You can execute the `list` command to list all the tasks in order of their task number. Search through your desired task and its corresponding task number. For example, if your desired task is "do calculus assignment" and the output of the `list` command is given as follows:*<br>

```
Here are the tasks in your list:
1. [T][ ] do calculus assignment
2. [D][ ] write up user guide for cs2103T ip (by: 17 Feb 2023 11:59PM)
3. [E][X] christmas party @ ben's (from: 25 Dec 2023 6:00PM to: 26 Dec 2023 2:00AM)
```

*then the corresponding task number you are looking for is 1.*<br><br>


> **I can't seem to save my changes made to the task list from the previous session. What is happening?**<br>

*You have probably closed the GUI through the ‚ùå button on the top left of the app window, force quit or pressing Ctrl+C in your CLI, rather than ending the chat session through the `bye` command. At the moment, the app is only able to save your changes upon exiting the chat session through the `bye` command.*<br><br>


> **Help! I'm unable to open the app and nothing happens after double clicking the JAR file...**<br>

*You should run the app's JAR file through the command `java -jar duke.txt` on your CLI.*<br><br>


> **I'm still unable to open the app's JAR file after running the command `java -jar duke.txt` on my CLI! I keep getting this error: `Error: Unable to access jarfile duke.jar`.**<br>

*Before running the command, make sure that on the CLI, you are in the same directory (folder) that contains the downloaded JAR file.*<br><br>
