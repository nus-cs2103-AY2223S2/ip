### **Remembering your tasks between sessions**
Colette can remember the state of your task list between sessions!
Simply ensure that if you move the `colette.jar` file, the `data` folder remains in the same directory
as the jar file.

## FAQ

### **Colette can't read my dates**
You've likely provided a date in the wrong format. Colette can only read dates in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### **Colette keeps saying the index is too high**
There arenâ€™t that many tasks in your list. You can check
the tasks in your list with the [list command](#listing-all-tasks).
