## Quick start

1. Ensure you have **Java 11** or above installed in your computer. You can check by opening a command terminal, and run `java --version`. If **Java** is not installed, or the version is **10** or below, you can install the lastest **Java** version [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/).
1. Download the lastest version of **Voile** [here](https://github.com/VietAnh1010/ip/releases).
1. Copy the downloaded file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for the application.
1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the file in, and run `java -jar Voile.jar`. A **GUI** simmlar to below should appear in a few seconds.<br>

If you want to use the **CLI** instead, you can run `java -jar voile.jar cli`.
1. Start typing commands in the command box and press **Enter** to execute it. Type `help` for more details about the commands that you can use in the application.

## Features

### Notes about the command format

- Arguments in square brackets are optional. For example, `help [command]` can be used as `help` or `help list`.
- Arguments in angle brackets are compulsory. For example, `todo <description>` must be used as `todo watch football`.
- In `EEE` day format, the first character is an uppercase character, the rest are lowercase characters. For example, `Mon` follows `EEE` format, but `mon` does not. However, some commands will automatically convert your input to the correct case - you can use `help` command, or read this user guide for the exact details.

### Automatically save data

**Voile** data are saved in the hard disk automatically after you exit the application. There is no need to save the data manually.

- If you are using the **CLI** version, **do not** interupt the application using **Ctrl+C**.
- Saved data is stored at `<home-folder>/.voile/tasklist.ser`, where `home-foler` is the home folder of the application.
- Data will not be saved if your application exit abnormally.

### Manage 3 kinds of tasks

There are 3 kinds of tasks in **Voile**: **TODO**, **DEADLINE** and **EVENT**. All tasks store _descriptions_ about them - these _descriptions_ are specified by you and can be modified when needed.
