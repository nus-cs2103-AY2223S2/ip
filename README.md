# Shao

Shao is a `chat bot application` that allows one to manage tasks via the command line interface.

## Setting up in VS code

Prerequisites: JDK 19

1. Open Visual Studio Code (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
1. Open the project into VS Code as follows:

   1. Click `File` -> `Open Folder`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.

1. After that, locate the `src/main/java/seedu/shao/Shao.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Java` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:

```Text

  What can I do for you?
