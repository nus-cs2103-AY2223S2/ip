1. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   1. Click `Open`.
   1. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   1. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
1. Configure the project to use **JDK 11** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.


## Work In Progress
- [X] README
- [ ] Add more `Date` and `Time` parsing formats
- [ ] Include more JUnit tests
- [ ] Automate more using Gradle
   - [X] Run checkstyle after building

- [ ] Add more Flags to ...
   - [ ] load configuration files
   - [ ] open specific task list (requires multi- task lists feature)

## Extra Features Ideas
* Add `help` for in-application support (see [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/projectDuke/index.html#c-help))
* Option to `list` all uncompleted (or completed) tasks
* Manage multiple task lists
* Have a config file to allow user preferences
   * Custom date/time input format
   * Custom separator for mass operations (e.g. mark, unmark, delete)
* Background auto-save

## Known / Potential Bugs
