**TrumpBot** is a desktop chatbot that will help you manage your tasks. It offers the convenience of a Command Line Interface (CLI) with the added benefit of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). With TrumpBot, you can manage your tasks and get more done in less time, especially if you're a fast typist. 

Here's to making task scheduling great again!

## Quick Setup

1. Ensure you have `Java 11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `duke.jar` from here.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your **TrumpBot**.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in
5. Use the command: `java -jar duke.jar` to run the application.
6. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.
